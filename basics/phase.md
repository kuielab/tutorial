# Phase


While many source separation papers mainly focus on their approaches for creating
better mask estimates, which only apply to the magnitude components of a
TF Representation, the other crucial aspect of sound is its phase.

In this section, we will discuss the important problem of how to turn a magnitude
spectrogram of an estimated source back into a waveform so that we may listen to
the source estimation.


## Phase - A Quick Primer

Phase is the instantaneous amplitude of an audio signal. Phase is a fundamental part of representing
the signal.

An audio signal, $y(t)$, composed of exactly one sine wave,

$$
y(t) = A \sin (2 \pi f t + \phi)
$$

can be completely described by the parameters $t, A, f$ and $\phi$, where
$t$ represents time in seconds, $A$ is the wave's amplitude (unit-less), $f$ is
its frequency in Hz, and $\phi$ is its phase offset in radians (_i.e.,_ where
in the cycle the wave is at $t=0$). If $\phi \ne 0$, then the sine wave appears
shifted in time by $\frac{\phi}{2 \pi f}$, where negative values "delay" the
signal and positive values "advance" it. Recall that a sine wave is the same
value every $2 \pi f$ seconds,
_i.e._

$$
\sin (0) = \sin(2 \pi f) = \sin(2k \pi f) ~ \forall ~ k \in \mathbb{Z}.
$$

This is inherent the periodicity of the sine wave, and the point where the phase
"wraps around" or essentially restarts at 0 every $2 \pi f$ seconds.

Let's scale this up. Our old pal Fourier told us that
[any sound can be represented as an infinite summation of sine waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform)
each with their own amplitudes, frequencies, and phase offsets. This means that any sound
we hear can be represented as many, many tuples of $(t, A, f, \phi)$.

Let's think back
to the section about time-frequency representations: each bin is index by time
along the x-axis and frequency along the y-axis.
We'll be a little hand-wavy here, but we can think of a TF bin as a "snapshot"
of the sound at that particular time and at that particular frequency component.
In a magnitude spectrogram, power spectrogram, log spectrogram, etc, each value
represents the sound's energy for that frequency at that time. So, if you're keeping
track at home, a spectrogram has entries for $t, A$ and $f$, but _no representation
for the phase $\phi$._

Phase is crucial to be able to describe and audio signal. Why don't most source separation
approaches model phase information?

## Why We Don't Model Phase

```{figure} ../images/basics/real_vs_fake_phase.png

The structure of phase within an STFT makes it hard to model.
One of these two images shows the phase component of an STFT and another
shows random noise. Can you guess which is which?
```

Let's do a little experiment. Above are two images. One of the two images shows
the phase component of an audio signal, the other shows white noise. Can you
guess which is which? [^fn2]

Therein lies the problem: there is a complicated interplay between how the
DFT captures the signal at each time step, how the frequency is captured
and how the phase is captured. Let's build some intuition for why this is.
For the same time step, the lower frequency components of the signal change less
quickly than the higher frequency components. This means that for any two adjacent
time steps, the time difference is the same but the amount of change of any frequency
might not be the same. The phase wraparound happens much quicker at the higher frequencies
than at the lower frequencies.


```{figure} ../images/basics/phase_sensitivity.gif

alt: Phase is sensitive to frequency and its initial starting point.

Getting a snapshot of the phase (the black dotted vertical lines) is very
sensitive to the frequencies and initial phases of the sine waves. This
is similar to what happens when take an STFT: many snapshots of sine waves
with many frequencies and initial phase offsets.
```


The gif above shows a sine wave with varying frequency and initial phase.
The frequency starts at A440, or 440 Hz and gradually changes frequency up an octave higher (880
Hz). The initial phase also changes in the interval $[0.0, 2\pi]$.
The dotted black lines show two shapshots of the value of the sine wave as the frequency and
initial phase both change.
Notice how sensitive the snapshot are to changes in the frequency and initial phase.

Another big difficulty when dealing with phase is that humans do not always
perceive phase differences, _i.e._,
a sine wave with $\phi = 0$ sounds the same as a sine wave with $\phi' \ne 0$

This is all to say that getting phase right is _hard_. That being said, there are ways
to estimate phase, but few if any source separation approaches
(or sound generation models) attempt to explicitly model phase to the same extent
that magnitude information is modeled. We will discuss some of these phase estimation
techniques below.

## How to Deal with Phase

### The Easy Way

For a mask-based source separation approach, a easy and very common way to deal with phase
is to just **copy the phase from the mixture!**
The mixture phase is sometimes referred to as the _noisy phase_.
This strategy isn't perfect, but researchers have discovered that it works surprisingly well, and
when things go wrong, it's usually not the fault of the phase.

So now, with this in place, we finally have our first strategy to convert our
source estimate back to a waveform. Assume we have a mixture STFT,
$Y \in \mathbb{C}^{T \times F}$, and estimated mask
$\hat{M}_i \in [0.0, 1.0]^{T \times F}$ for Source $i$.
Recall that we can apply the mask to a magnitude spectrogram of $Y$ like so:

$$
\hat{X}_i = \hat{M}_i \odot |Y|
$$

where $\hat{X}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$ represents a magnitude spectrogram of
our source estimate. Note that this equation looks similar if we want to apply
a mask to a power spectrogram ($|Y|^2$), log spectrogram ($\log |Y|$), etc.

Now we can just copy the phase from the mixture over to the magnitude spectrogram
of our source estimate, $\hat{X}_i$:

$$
\tilde{X}_i = \hat{X}_i \odot e^{j \cdot \angle Y}
$$

where we use $j = \sqrt{-1}$, "$\angle$" to represent the angle of the complex-valued
STFT of $Y$, and $\tilde{X}_i \in \mathbb{C}^{T \times F}$ to indicate
that the estimate for Source $i$ is now complex-valued similar to an STFT.

Putting it all together it looks like:

$$
\tilde{X_i} = (\hat{M}_i \odot |Y|) \odot e^{j \cdot \angle Y}.
$$

This math looks pretty complicated, but this is really just a few lines of code:

```python
def apply_mask_with_noisy_phase(mix_stft, mask):
    mix_magnitude, mix_phase = np.abs(mix_stft), np.angle(mix_stft)
    src_magnitude = mix_magnitude * mask
    src_stft = src_magnitude * np.exp(1j * mix_phase)
    return src_stft
```


### The Hard Way, Part 1: Phase Estimation

It is possible to _estimate_ the phase once the estimated mask is applied to the
mixture spectrogram. One popular way is the Griffin-Lim algorithm {cite}`griffin1984signal`,
which attempts to reconstruct the phase component of a spectrogram by iteratively
computing an STFT and an inverse STFT. Griffin-Lim usually converges in 50-100
iterations, although faster methods have been developed {cite}`perraudin2013fast`.
In our experience, Griffin-Lim can still leave artifacts in the audio.

```{tip}
`librosa` has an implementation of Griffin-Lim [here](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/generated/librosa.griffinlim.html).
```

Multiple Input Spectrogram Inversion (MISI) is a variant of Girffin-Lim specifically
designed for source separation with multiple sources. It adds an additional
constraint to the original algorithm such that all of the estimated sources with
estimated phase components must all add up to the input mixture. {cite}`gunawan2010iterative`

It's worth noting that the STFT & iSTFT computations, and these phase estimation
algorithms are all differentiable. This means that we can incorporate them as
part of neural network architectures and train directly on the waveforms, even
when using mask-based algorithms. {cite}`wichern2018phase,le2019phasebook,masuyama2019deep`


### The Hard Way, Part 2:  Waveform Estimation

Finally, a recent way that researchers have been tackling the phase problem is
by side-stepping any explicit representations of it at all. Recently, many
deep learning-based models have been proposed that are "end-to-end", meaning that
the model's input and output are all waveforms. In this case, the model decides
how it wants to represent phase. This might not always be the most efficient
or effective solution, although many ways to mitigate the drawbacks of this tactic
are currently being researched. {cite}`engel2018gansynth,engel2019ddsp`



[^fn1]: The amplitude, loudness, and energy of a sound are all calculated differently
 but still related. Here we will use "amplitude" as a stand-in for whichever one you
 choose.

[^fn2]: We won't keep you guessing forever: the real phase is on the left. This signal
 was converted from an mp3 so there is a low-pass shelf at ~17 kHz, which is noticeable once
 you know what you're looking for. There is no data above the shelf though, so this
 is actually an artifact, not a true representation of the signal.
