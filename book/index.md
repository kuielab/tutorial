Welcome to the website for our tutorial at [MDX Workshop @ ISMIR 2021](https://mdx-workshop.github.io/)!
We appreciate the presenters of the previous source separation [tutorial @ ISMIR 2020](https://source-separation.github.io/tutorial/landing.html), Ethan Manilow, Prem Seetharaman, and Justin Salamon 
{cite}`opensourceseparation:book`. 
This tutorial website borrows heavily from this [repository](https://github.com/source-separation/tutorial). 

This tutorial overviews fundamental approaches to music demixing
and presents three models that showed outstanding performance on the [Music Demixing Challenge 2021](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021).
Each section presents how to use pretrained models to separate a random track,
train models to reproduce results, and submit your model to the [AICrowd evaluation system](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021/submissions).

- If you are not familiar with music source separation, we highly recommend reading the previous materials from [tutorial @ ISMIR 2020](https://source-separation.github.io/tutorial/landing.html) 
{cite}`opensourceseparation:book`, which contains

  - A practical overview of source separation, including some history and current
   research trends,
  - A high-level intuition for how and why each source separation approach works,
  - The ability to make an educated decision about when and how to incorporate source
   separation into your own work,
  - A set of well-tested, open-source tools that you can use if you do choose to
   incorporate source separation into your work, or train your own models.


#### Desired Outcomes

The goal of this tutorial is that you leave with:

1. A practical overview of source separation, including some history and current
   research trends,
2. A high-level intuition for how and why each source separation approach works,
3. The ability to make an educated decision about when and how to incorporate source
   separation into your own work,
4. A set of well-tested, open-source tools that you can use if you do choose to
   incorporate source separation into your work, or train your own models.
   
After you go through this tutorial, you should be confident about using source
separation in your work and you should know which tools to reach for. We hope
this website will serve as a reference guide or starting point for your future
endeavours with source separation technology.
