# Representing Audio


The first thing we want to examine are the input and output representations of a source 
separation system and how the inputs and outputs are represented. In its most
unprocessed form, we assume that audio is stored as a waveform. Some source
separation approaches operate on the waveform directly, although many require
some preprocessing before separating sources. In this section, we will discuss
the different types of input and output representations that are commonly used
in source separation approaches.

We'll first start talking about waveforms, arguably the most fundamental representation
of audio, then we'll talk about what types of things are useful when we represent
audio for source separation before we move onto some common audio representations
for source separation.


## Waveforms

rate and quantized. Image used courtesy of Jan Van Balen (<a href="https://jvbalen.github.io/notes/waveform.html">source</a>).
```



A _waveform_ is shorthand for a digitized audio signal, which is most similar to
what the sound is like physically. For an acoustic sound, the air pressure of
over time changes, and is
recorded by a microphone, which converts the changes in air pressure to an electrical 
signal. The voltage of this signal is sampled at a regular time interval,
quantized, and converted to a digital array in a computer. This digital array is
what we call the waveform. Of course, this description glosses over a lot of
details in the realm of physics, acoustics, and signal processing. What's
important to know is that a continuous-time signal is discretized in both time
and amplitude. We say a signal is monophonic, or mono, if there
is only one audio channel, i.e., this array has shape $x \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times 1}$.
We say a signal is stereophonic, or stereo, if the array has two
channels, i.e., this array has shape $x \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times 2}$.

```{note}
Audio signals with more than 2 channels have many applications (e.g.
5.1 surround sound), including applications for in separating sources.
Approaches that input many audio channels for separation are typically refered
to under the title of _beamforming_ approaches. Beamforming is a related, but
separate area of active research. As such, the work we are going to cover in
this space is sometimes called _Single Channel Source Separation_.
```

An important aspect of the waveform is the sample rate, which describes how
many measurements, or samples, happen per second and is measured in Hertz, or
Hz[^fn2]. For a signal with sample rate $sr$, the maximum frequency that can be
reliably represented is $f_N=\frac{sr}{2}$, which is called the
[Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem).
For example, if a signal has a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, the highest
possible frequency is 22.05 kHz.

Many deep learning-based source separation approaches will reduce the sample
rate of their input signals (called downsampling) to reduce the
computational load during training time. Downsampling removes high frequency
information from a signal, which is seen as a necessary evil when prototyping
models. 

```{note}
All of the source separation approaches we will discuss assume that the sample
rate between the training, validation, and testing data is the same. The
assumptions that ensure the approaches work are violated if the sample rate is
variable. For example, if a system expects a signal at 16 kHz, then
all input audio should be resampled to 16 kHz before using it.
```


## Desirable Properties of Representations

displaying a mixture of two single-frequency sine waves; panel (a) represents
the waveform and panel (b) shows the frequency spectrum. The second row has two 
ways of displaying a mixture of two linear chirp signals (_i.e._, sine waves
with rising frequency); panel (c) shows a frequency spectrum and panel (d) shows
a time-frequency representation. Notice how a signal that looks completely
unseparable in one representation becomes easily separable in another representation.

It can be argued that a source separation approach is only as good as its ability
to represent audio in a separable manner. With that in mind, it's important
to understand how audio itself is represented for the purposes of source separation.
For the source separation approaches we will explore here, we will see many
variations on the same theme, namely:

1. Convert the audio to a representation easy to separate
2. Separate the audio by manipulating this representation
3. Convert the audio back from the manipulated representation to get isolated sources.

Almost every source separation approach we discuss here--classic and deep--can
be broken down into these three steps. We want to note that each of these three 
steps might in fact involve multiple separate substeps.

Therefore an important aspect of an audio representation is invertability, or
whether a signal that is converted from a waveform to a new representation can
reliably be converted back to a waveform with little-to-no error. Artifacts that
arise from converting back and forth will be audible in our separation output, so
we want to minimize these types of errors (although eliminating them does not
guarantee a perfect separation).

An other important aspect is whether this representation can keep data from 
one source apart from another source. As seen in {numref}`representation-img`, 
some representations might be better suited to separate certain signals than other
representations. In this tutorial we will explore methods that produce representations
specifically designed for separating sources.

Some recent source separations approaches use deep learning to learn a representation
directly from the waveform, while others use preprocessing tools that are common 
in the audio signal processing and music information retrieval literature as a first
step.

We will first discuss time frequency representations because they are 
an important preprocessing step, the parameters of which could have an impact
on the separation quality of your approach.


## Input Representations



### Time-Frequency (TF) Representations

```{figure} ../images/basics/tf_representation.png
---
alt: A time-frequency representation.
name: tf-repr
---
A time-frequency representation. One dimension is indexed by time, another is 
index by frequency, and values in the matrix represent the energy of the sound
at that partifular time and frequency.
```

A Time-Frequency {cite}`smith2011spectral` representation is a 2 dimensional
matrix that represents the frequency contents of an audio signal over time.
There are many types of time-frequency representations out in the world, but we
will only discuss those that are most frequently used for source separation here.

We call a specific entry in this matrix a TF bin. We can visualize a 
TF Representation using a heatmap, which has time along the x-axis and
frequency along the y-axis. Each TF bin in the heatmap represents the amplitude
of the signal at that particular time and frequency. Some heatmaps have a colorbar
alongside them that shows which colors indicate high amplitude values and which
colors indicate low amplitude values. If there is no color bar, it is usually
safe to assume that brighter colors indicate higher amplitudes than darker colors.

Time-frequency representations are the most common types of representations used
in source separation approaches. Below we will outline some of the most popular
and fundamental time-frequency representations.


#### Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT)

```

Many of the time-frequency representations that we will see in this tutorial
start out as a Short-time Fourier Transform or STFT. An STFT is calculated 
from a waveform representation by computing a 
[discrete Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform)
(DFT) of a small, moving window[^fn1] across the duration of the window. The location
of each entry in an STFT determines its time (x-axis) and frequency (y-axis). The
absolute value of a TF bin $|X(t, f)|$ at time $t$ and frequency $f$ determines the 
amount of energy heard from frequency $f$ at time $t$.

Importantly, each bin in our STFT is _complex_, meaning each entry contains both
a magnitude component and a phase component. Both components are needed to convert
an STFT matrix back to a waveform so that we may hear it.

The STFT is invertable, meaning that a complex valued STFT can be converted back
to a waveform. This is called the inverse Short-time Fourier Transform or iSTFT.

Here are some important parameters to consider when computing an STFT:

##### Window Types

```{figure} ../images/basics/window_types.png
---
alt: Six commonly used window types for calculating an STFT.
name: window_types
---
Six commonly used window types for calculating an STFT.
```

The window type determines the shape of the short-time window that will segment
the audio into short segments before applying the DFT. The shape of this window
will affect which frequencies get emphasized or attenuated in the DFT. There
are many types of window functions, in {numref}`window_types`, we show the most
common ones when calculating an STFT for source separation. For more information
on other types of windows and their frequency response, please see `scipy.signal`'s
documentation [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.windows.html).


```{tip}
We have informally noticed that our models acheive the best performance using
the `sqrt_hann` window, shown above. 
```

##### Window Length

```{figure} ../images/basics/win_len.png
---
alt: Trade off between time and frequency resolution for different window lengths.
name: window_lens
---
Trade off between time and frequency resolution for different window lengths.
In the simplified case, the number of frequency bins is determined by the window
length.
Using the same signal, we compute the STFT once with window length 512, and
again with window length 1024. The white space is where there is no STFT data,
which is left in to intentionally show how time and frequency interplay with
the window length.
```

The window length determines how many samples are included in each short-time
window. Due to how the DFT is computed, this parameter also determines the
resolution of the frequency axis of the STFT. The longer the window, the higher
the frequency resolution and vice versa, as is visible in {numref}`window_lens`.

##### Hop Length

```{figure} ../images/basics/hop_len.png
---
alt: The hope length determines the distance (in samples) between adjacent short-time windows.
name: hop_lens
---
The hop length determines the distance (in samples) between adjacent short-time
windows. An STFT is computed twice on the same signal; the smaller the hop length
the more times a particular segment of the audio signal is represented in the
STFT.
```

The hop length determines the distance, in samples, between any two adjacent
short-time windows. In the image shown in {numref}`hop_lens` shows how the hop
length can elongate or shorten the time axis on an STFT depending on how it is
set.

##### Overlap-Add

Many parameter settings for window type, window length, and hop length might
not reconstruct the original signal perfectly when converting a signal to an STFT
and back to a waveform. However, a certain set of parameters 
is mathematically guaranteed to perfectly reconstruct any signal. These parameter sets
are called Constant Overlap-Add (COLA) because when applying successive windows,
they add up to a [constant value](https://www.dsprelated.com/freebooks/sasp/Constant_Overlap_Add_COLA_Cases.html).

In general, we tend to use a hop length that is half of the window length, but
there are [many documented COLA settings](https://gist.github.com/endolith/c5b39ab78f1910e99cadaced9b839fc1),
and an [easy way to check if a tuple of settings is COLA](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.check_COLA.html).


#### Magnitude, Power, and Log Spectrograms

```{figure} ../images/basics/ylinear_specs.png
---
alt: Four types of spectrograms with different scaling for function.
name: spectrograms
---
A visual comparison of the four types of spectrograms discussed in this section.
Each has a different scaling function applied to the loudness, which is reflected
in the colors of the heatmap plots.
```

As we will touch on later in this tutorial, it is hard to model the
phase of a signal. Therefore most source separation approaches only operate on
the some variant of the spectrogram that does not explicitly represent phase in
each TF bin. A visualization of four types of spectrograms is shown
in {numref}`spectrograms`.

**Magnitude Spectrogram** 
For a complex-valued STFT, $X \in \mathbb{C}^{T \times F}$, the Magnitude
Spectrogram is calculated by taking the absolute value of each element in the
STFT, $|X| \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$. 

**Power Spectrogram**
For a complex-valued STFT, $X \in \mathbb{C}^{T \times F}$, the Power
Spectrogram is calculated by squaring  each element in the
STFT, $|X|^2 \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$.

**Log Spectrogram**
Human hearing is logarithmic with regards to amplitude. 
For a complex-valued STFT, $X \in \mathbb{C}^{T \times F}$, the Log
Spectrogram is calculated taking the log of the absolute value of each element in the
STFT, $\log{|X|} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$.

**Log Power Spectrogram**
For a complex-valued STFT, $X \in \mathbb{C}^{T \times F}$, the Log
Spectrogram is calculated taking the log of the square of each element in the
STFT, $\log{|X|^2} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$.


```{tip}
Even though it is hard to visualize the detail in a magnitude or power spectrogram,
some source separation algorithms work completely fine on these representations, while
some need log spectrograms. Make sure to set your spectrograms correctly!
```


```{note}
A note on terminology: while researchers might loosely interchange "STFT" and
"spectrogram", the term "spectrogram" is mostly used to describe a TF Representation
that does not have any explicit phase representation. As such "spectrogram" might
refer to a Magnitude Spectrogram, Power Spectrogram, Log Spectrogram, Mel Spectrogram,
Log Mel Spectrogram, or similar. Use context clues to determine which representation
is being discussed when possible.
```


#### Mel-spaced Spectrograms

scale: 35%
---
A visual comparison of linear-scaled vs mel-spaced y axies.
Lower frequencies have a larger representation in a mel-spaced spectrogram.
```

Human hearing is also logarithmic with regards to frequencies. The 
[Mel scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) approximates this property
and is a quick way to make the frequency axis of a spectrogram 
quasi-logarithmic[^fn3]. This is also commonly used to reduce the computational
load on deep learning-based approaches, because the number of Mel-spaced frequency
bins is often lower then the number of linearly-spaced frequency bins.

A visual comparison is shown in {numref}`mel_spectrograms`. Notice the how the
y-axis in the Mel-spaced spectrogram is quasi-logarithmic, squishing higher frequencies
and leaving more space for lower frequencies.


### Other Representations

A few other representations have been explored in the literature. We provide references
for a few below:

  - General Calculation: {cite}`brown1991calculation,brown1992efficient`
  - Use in source separation: {cite}`rafii2011degenerate,fuentes2012blind,jaiswal2011clustering,ganseman2012improving,shi2019cqt`

- 2-Dimensional Fourier Transform (2DFT) {cite}`seetharaman2017music`
- Per Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN) {cite}`lostanlen2018per`


## Output Representations

Ultimately, all source separation algorithms must be able to convert the audio
that they processed back to a waveform. While some algorithms output waveforms
directly, many algorithms output masks, which will be covered in more detail in
the next sections. The masks get applied to the original mixture spectrogram,
and that result is converted back to a waveform.

One thing to note is that if I have a waveform estimate for Source $i$ from my
mixture, then it is easy to calculate what the mixture sounds like _without_ 
Source $i$ present. Simply element-wise subtract the source waveform from the
mixture waveform.


## Which is Better? Inputting a Waveform or a Time-Frequency Representation?

Very few non-deep learning source separation approaches operate directly
on waveforms, so we will restrict our answer to deep learning methods, which
have dominated the field for the past few years. Even still, the answer is that
it depends!

While this may change in the coming years, in general, determining which
approach is best a _very hard_ problem, as we will see in the
{ref}`evaluation` section.

In recent years, many state-of-the-art systems for music separation
have used both spectrogram and waveforms as input. However, research in
speech separation has mostly converged upon using the waveform as input. This
may be a sign of things to come for music separation; we'll have to wait and
see!

By the end of this tutorial, we hope that you will be able to make an educated
decision about which type of source system is right for your goals.
