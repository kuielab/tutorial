Beamforming
  A related, but separate area of research that tries to estimate isolate sources
  using multiple recordings of an auditory scene from different angles and locations.

DFT
  "Discrete Fourier Transform"

Downsample
  Resample an audio signal such that the sample rate is lower than it originally
  was.

Mono
  An audio signal is _monophonic_, or _mono_, if it only has one channel of audio data.

Monophonic
  An audio signal is _monophonic_, or _mono_, if it only has one channel of audio data.

Sample
  A single measurement from a continuous-time signal that becomes a
  discrete-time signal.

Sample Rate
  The number of digital samples that occur per second.

Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT)
  A time-frequency representation that has phase and magnitude.

Stereo
  An audio signal is _stereophonic_, or _stereo_, if it has exactly two channels of audio data.

Stereophonic
  An audio signal is _stereophonic_, or _stereo_, if it has exactly two channels of audio data.

STFT
  "Short-time Fourier Transform"

TF
  "Time-Frequency"

TF bin
  A single value in a Time-Frequency matrix.

TF Representation
  A general term for any 2D representation of audio that represents time along 
  one axis and frequency (or pitch) along the other. This might be an STFT, a 
  spectrogram, CQT, LogMel-Spectrogram, etc.

Upsample
  Resample an audio signal such that the sample rate is higher than it originally
  was.
