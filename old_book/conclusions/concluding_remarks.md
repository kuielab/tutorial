Concluding Remarks
==================


In this tutorial we have taken a pragmatic approach to learning
about source separation. From the basics, through data and training,
we have explored open source projects that enables modern source
separation research and can further your own projects. We hope
this tutorial has been as fun to read as it was for us to put it
together.


Thank you so much for reading! Happy separating! :D
