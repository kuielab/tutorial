Building Blocks
===============


In this section we will do a quick overview of neural network components
at a conceptual level,
paying special attention to how they are used within modern source
separation systems.

Neural networks, sometimes called _deep learning_ (or some variant of
"neural networks" and "deep learning" like "deep nets"), are a type of
machine learning algorithm that have become very popular in the past few
years. While we will cover gradient descent in a later section, we will
not fully dive into the mathematics neural networks.

There are many, many resources for learning about neural networks,
so we won't repeat everything here, but we do want to leave you with
some intuition about how the work and importantly, **how they work within the
source separation context.**


On this page we will discuss the most common types of neural network
components used in source separation systems.




## Neural Network Components

### Layers

Neural networks are composed of _layers_, each of which has a set
of weights that get updated through gradient descent.

When we talk
about network layers, we usually talk about _forward_ and _backward_
passes through the network. During the forward pass, each layer
receives input from a previous layer or input data and transforms
the data by multiplying each component of the input by a set of
_weights_, the result of which is the output. Usually the way the
inputs are ingested and outputs calculated is a little more complicated
that this, but what's important to know is that as an example input
gets pumped through a neural network it goes through many discrete
transformations, each of which is a layer.

It's important to know that almost all deep net source separation
systems are trained with some variant of
[Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent),
which means that data is passed through each layer in _minibatches_ 
(sometimes referred to as just _batches_).

```{tip} 
An important first step for debugging neural networks is understanding
the input and output dimensionality at each layer. In many frameworks
(_e.g._, [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), or [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)),
the dimensionality is referred to as each layer's `shape`.

In many cases, getting the shapes set up right will get you 90% of the
way there to a working system.
```


#### Fully Connected Layers

```


In a fully connected layer, every node is connected to every input node
and is connected to every output node. These are sometimes called _linear_
layers because, without an activation function, they apply a linear transform
to the input data.

Fully connected layers have many uses, but a common use is to expand or
compress the dimensionality of the input for the next layer. In this
sense, they can be thought of as a kind of "glue" between other components.

##### Masking

Within source separation, fully connected layers are usually used to
create masks, changing the dimensionality of the previous layer so
that it matches the dimensionality of the output (_e.g._, the number of
frequency components in a spectrogram or number of samples in a waveform).
The fully connected layers usually have an activation function when used
as a mask, discussed further below.


##### Reshaping

As we mentioned, linear layers are well suited to expand or compress the
dimensionality of the input data. There are many ways we can take advantage
of this property within source separation.

Here's a simple example: Let's say we have a source separation system
that applies a mask to a spectrogram that has 513 frequency components and
400 time steps. When we include the batch dimension, the output shape of 
our fully connected layer might look like `(16, 400, 513)`, where the
first dimension is the batch (with 16 examples). But if we want this
system to make _two_ masks, we can change the output dimensionality of
this fully connected layer to be `(16, 400, 1026)`,
where now we've doubled the frequency dimensions ($513 \times 2 = 1026$)
to indicate that we have two sources. Then we can reshape the output
such that it looks like `(16, 400, 513, 2)`, where we've expanded the frequency
out into the last dimension to take care of both of our sources.
The network will learn that this means there are two sources.

A similar thing happens with Deep Clustering (covered on the next page).
We use a linear layer to produce a high-dimensional embedding space
and then reshape it so that we can make sense of it.

#### Recurrent Layers

```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/rnn.png
---
alt: An unfolded recurrent node
name: rnn
---
Recurrent layers have self-connected loops. When the loops are
"unfolded" they show how each loop represents a different time step.
[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Colored_neural_network.svg)
```

Recurrent layers are layers that have connections to themselves, as well
as to the next layer. In other words, some of the outputs of the nodes
are plugged back into the inputs of the same nodes, making loops so that
information to persist.

Because of these loops, recurrent layers are
particularly well suited for learning data that varies over time, like
audio. Each loop can ingest the next set of data in steps. The way that
recurrent layers are used in source separation is that they ingest the
audio as it changes along time. So, for example, if we have a spectrogram
that is input into a recurrent layer, the recurrent layer will ingest
one column of the spectrogram at a time (_i.e._, all of the frequency
components or the entire spectrum at that time step).

The number of units recurrent layers have defines their
_receptive field_ or the amount of time steps the layer can see at any
given time. So for instance, if a spectrogram has 1000 time steps
but the recurrent layer only has 400 units, only 400 time steps of
the spectrogram will be processed by the recurrent layers at a time.
It will start with the first time step, and work its way across every
one of the 1000 time steps, advancing by one step at a time. Because
of this, if you train a recurrent layer that only has 400 time steps, 
it can accept spectrograms of any length. This is not the case for
convolutional layers, which we will cover shortly.

```

````

The two most common types of recurrent layers are 
**[Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)** layers 
and **[Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_recurrent_unit)** layers.
Although there are 
slight differences between the two, what's important to know is that
these layers are able to retain information in a way that is stable,
whereas naive recurrent layers like those shown in {numref}`rnn` are
_not_ stable.

For source separation, researcher mostly use **LSTM** layers. We are unaware of
any reason that source separation researchers have settled on LSTMs over
GRUs, but it is surely the case that GRUs are much less common in the literature
than LSTMs.


For more details on how LSTMs and GRUs work, see
[Christopher Olah's terrific blog post.](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

##### Bidirectional or Unidirectional?

It is very common to see recurrent layers that are _bidirectional_, meaning
that they actually contain two sets of units: one that advances forward
in time and another that advances backward in time. The bidirectional
case can thus "see the future" because it starts at the end of an audio
clip. Because of this you should **not** use bidirectional recurrent
layers if you need a real time system.

Unidirectional recurrent layers
are called _causal_ and bidirectional recurrent are called _noncausal_.
If an LSTM or GRU is bidirectional, it is denoted as BLSTM or BGRU,
respectively.


```{admonition} Watch out!
There is some sloppiness when research papers report the details of
their BLSTM/BGRU layers. For instance, if a paper says they used a
"BLSTM with 600 units", does that mean 600 units in each direction
or 300 in each direction (600 total)?

Personally, we assume that "600 units" means 600 in _each direction_, because
[that's how the pytorch API configures it](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LSTM.html#torch.nn.LSTM)
but this might not always be the case. Beware of this when reading papers!
```

#### Convolutional Layers



Convolutional layers are similar to fully connected layers shown above,
except that now each node is only connected to a small set of nodes 
from the previous layers. Reducing the amount of connections makes
the network less prone to overfitting to the training data. Convolutional
layers also have the property that they are
[translationally invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_symmetry).

Convolutional layers are related to the mathematical/signal processing
concept of [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) in
that convolutional layers learn a set of _filters_ from a sliding window
of the input layer. This sliding window is the receptive field of the 
convolutional layer. A depiction of convolutional layers are
shown below.


##### The Shapes of Convolutions

````{panels}

```

````

One tricky thing about convolutions is that their output shape can
change wildly depending on how you set up the layers. There are
four main parameters that effect the output shape of a convolutional
layer: _kernel size_, _stride_, _padding_, and _dilation_.

The _kernel size_ dictates the number and shape of nodes from the
previous layer that nodes at the current layer see (the shape of
the window), and the _stride_ dictates the distance that
the window moves between adjacent input nodes. 

````{panels}

```

````

The padding determines what to do at the edge of the input. If there is
no padding, then the inputs at the edge are only covered by the colvolutional
layer nodes at the edge, but if there _is_ padding then the inputs at
the edge get covered by more convolutional nodes. Padding is shown in 
{numref}`conv3`.

Dilation determines the spacing between the input nodes that each
convolutional node sees. This allows each node to understand more
context than if no dilation is used. A gif of dilation is shown in 
{numref}`conv4`. Dilation is perhaps most famous in the audio world
because of its use in Wavenet {cite}`oord2016wavenet`, which used
dilated convolutions in an autoregressive manner to produce one sample
of a waveform at a time. [^fn1]


**Transpose Convolutions**  
Typically the output of convolutional layers have a smaller dimensionality
than the input layers, however we might want the opposite to happen 
where we expand the input. This is called a _transpose convolution_ layer or
_deconvolutional_ layer, and the process is similar to the regular
convolutional layer.

**Pooling**

```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/Max_pooling.png

[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Max_pooling.png)
```

An important part of using convolutional layers is _pooling_ or
reducing the dimensionality of a convolutional layer using some 
non-linear function, like a `max()` operation. Pooling splits the
input into non-overlapping regions and performs the downsampling
function on each region. Pooling is technically
a separate layer, but it is almost always found after a convolutional 
layer. The most common type of pooling is _max pooling_, although
other types of pooling exist like _average pooling_.

about how these parameters affect the convolutional shapes. {cite}`dumoulin2016guide`


##### In Source Separation

In source separation, convolutions have been used to great effect in
the waveform and time-frequency domains. In the waveform domain,
1D convolutions are used to input and output waveforms, and in the 
time-frequency domain 2D convolutions are used to input spectrograms
and output masks.


```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/tasnet_filterbanks.png

models (covered
on the next page), which was trained on speech. Figure (a) shows the 
learned filterbanks of a causal model and Figure (b) shows a noncausal
model.
Notice how most of the energy of the filterbanks is in the range
of human speech.

```

When we say that convolutions learn a set of filters (or, a _filterbank_),
this relates to the concept of filters that we normally think of in audio, like
high-pass, low-pass, or band-pass filters. For instance, when we learn
a 1D convolutional layer from a waveform, each of the nodes is learning
a filter from the data. For instance, {numref}`tasnet_filterbanks` shows
the result of two networks with convolutional layers that output a waveform.
The image shows the learned filterbanks from the networks, which were
trained on human speech. 

Unlike recurrent layers that can process one time step at a time,
convolutional layers have to have a full example with the exact input
shape in order to process data. For example, if we have a spectrogram
with 512 frequency bins and 1000 time steps above, but our first convolutional
layer requires an input shape of `(512, 128)`, we have to split our
spectrogram into 8 windows of size exactly 128 and include the necessary
padding on the last window.


Convolutional layers can sometimes have a hard time with edge effects.
For instance, when predicting a waveform it is possible that a
convolutional neural network might learn discontinuities,
which might lead to audible artifacts. One way around this is to
output overlapping windows similar to how an STFT is computed. Going
back to the above example with a spectrogram, we might instead 
split it into 16 windows of the same length, but overlap with on
another.

### Activation Functions

---
How an activation function is applied in a network. Each node has a
"weight", which get combined and passed through the activation function.
[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ArtificialNeuronModel_english.png)
```

Activation functions change how much one layer influences the next layer.
For each node in a layer, the activation function "decides" whether 
that node should be "on" or "off". Activation functions are usually
non-linear and always [differentiable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function).

It is usually important to have at least one layer with a non-linear
activation function. A list of many activation function can be seen
on this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function).
The most common ones seen in source separation
are discussed below:


#### Sigmoid

```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/sigmoid.png
---
scale: 50%
alt: A plot of the sigmoid activation function.
name: sigmoid
---
A plot of the Sigmoid activation function.
[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Logistic-curve.svg)
```

The `sigmoid` activation function is shown in {numref}`sigmoid` and
is used very commonly as the output of a neural net that creates masks.
Because it is bounded in the range $[0.0, 1.0]$ it is perfectly
suited to make {ref}`masks:softmasks`. It is sometimes denoted $\sigma$.



#### Tanh

```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/tanh.png
---
scale: 50%
alt: A plot of the tanh activation function.
name: tanh
---
A plot of the tanh activation function.
[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Activation_tanh.svg)
```

The `tanh`, or the hyperbolic tangent, activation function is
shown in {numref}`tanh`. Tanh is similar to sigmoid, but it is bounded
in the range $[-1.0, 1.0]$, instead of $[0.0, 1.0]$ like sigmoid.
For this reason it is more common to find a `tanh` in the
middle of a source separation network than at the ends.


#### ReLU & Friends

```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/relu.png
---
scale: 50%
alt: A plot of the ReLU activation function.
name: relu
---
A plot of the ReLU activation function.
[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Activation_rectified_linear.svg)
```

The Rectified Linear Unit, or `relu` activation function is shown
above in {numref}`relu`. It is $0.0$ if the input is less than $0.0$
and is linear with slope $1$ otherwise:


![relu_eq](../../images/deep_approaches/relu_eq.svg)

ReLUs are sometimes used to
make masks, and some systems use them to output waveforms as well.


```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/leaky_relu.png
---
scale: 50%
alt: A plot of the PReLU activation function.
name: leaky-relu
---
A plot of the PReLU activation function.
[Image Source](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Activation_prelu.svg)
```

Two related activation functions to ReLUs are the `Leaky ReLU` and `PReLU`.

The Leaky ReLU is similar to the regular ReLU, but instead of 
the output being $0.0$ below $x=0.0$ it is weighted ever so slightly above $0.0$ 
so that small updates will still be made:

![leaky_relu_eq](../../images/deep_approaches/leaky_relu_eq.svg)

And PReLU has a learnable network parameter $\alpha$ that defines the slope
below $x=0.0$:

![prelu_eq](../../images/deep_approaches/prelu_eq.svg)

These are sometimes used in middle layers or as an activation for the final
layer when outputting a waveform.


### Normalization

Normalization is the practice of making sure all of the inputs to a
network or a layer within a network all look the same from a statistical
standpoint. Practically, this means that all of the data should have
the same mean and standard deviation. Changing the mean _shifts_ the
data, which literally means adding or subtracting the calculated mean
to every data point, and changing the standard deviation _scales_ the
data, which literally means dividing every data point by the calculated
standard deviation. This process makes training neural networks
much more stable during training. 

There are a few different methods for which data to include in the mean
and standard deviation calculations. The most common types of normalization
in source separation are outlined below.

#### Batch Norm

_Batch normalization_, or _batch norm_, {cite}`ioffe2015batch` computes the
mean and standard
deviation of each mini-batch during training and normalizes the data
using those statistics. Like pooling, batch norm is considered another 
"layer" of a neural network and might be found in various places in a
network's architecture, including at the input layer.


#### Whitening your Data

Some researchers will normalize their whole dataset as a preprocessing step.
This is called _whitening_ the data. The concept is the same:
the mean and standard deviation of the whole dataset is used to shift and
scale the data. Because we need to access all of the data, this must
happen before we train a network (recall the net only sees mini-batches).

```{tip}
Though popular in speech separation research, we have not found whitening
to be of any practical use in music separation.
```


#### Learnable Normalization

The final method we will outline in detail is having the network
learn to normalize its inputs by itself. In this case, the system
has two learnable parameters for shifting and scaling. These parameters
are optimized using gradient descent, just like the other weights of
the net. When applied as a shift and scale function to network inputs,
the net will use it to normalize its input data based on what it determines
works best.

Open-Unmix, which we will discuss in more detail on the next page,
uses a learnable normalization parameters to great effect.

#### Other Normalization Techniques

There are many other normalization techniques that have been developed
and quite a few have been used in source separation research such as
_instance norm_ {cite}`ulyanov2016instance`. A great resource for
learning more about neural network normalization techniques is
outlined in the Group Normalization paper: {cite}`wu2018group`

### Dropout

Dropout is a regularization technique that improves a network's
ability to generalize to unseen data. This is a simple technique
whereby at each training step some percentage of the nodes are
set to 0. This is very widely used in source separation systems
and is essential to making them work well.

### Spectrogram Considerations

While waveforms can be input into a neural network, sometimes it is
desirable to explicitly represent frequency information by having
the network input a spectrogram. As such, the spectrograms must be
computed from the waveform to be ingested by the network. This
can be done as a preprocessing step, with all of the spectrogram
data stored to disk as a cache and loaded during the training 
process, or the spectrograms can
be computed on-the-fly when the network needs them.
Precomputing the spectrograms is usually quicker,
but usually requires a separate step to compute everything which might
take a significant amount of time and disk space to store the data.
On the other hand, computing spectrograms on-the-fly requires more
computation for each example, and might bottleneck your training
procedure if not done efficiently.

Many times it makes sense to decrease the size of the spectrogram.
This is because when we do this it allows us to make our networks
bigger, and thus it has more capacity to learn better. One way 
we can decrease the size of the spectrogram and still preserve
some features that are relevant to human hearing is by converting
the a linear-scale frequency axis to a mel-scale frequency axis.
Details about this are discussed

The computation of a spectrogram is completely differentiable, which
means that we can embed static, non-learnable STFT calculations in
our network architecture to make waveform-to-waveform models, if 
we so choose. This is useful if you want to use a spectrogram
model with one of the waveform losses outlined below. But beware:
this might noticeably slow down your training process.


## Loss Functions and Targets

The final piece of the neural network puzzle is loss functions.
As we mentioned at the top of this page, the loss is a function that
is used to determine the distance between the network's estimates
and the true sources. It is then used to update the parameters
of the network.


### Spectrogram Losses

When computing losses with spectrograms, we compare the spectrogram
of the true source to the input spectrogram with the network's mask
applied. Given some ground truth STFT for source $i$
$S_i \in \mathbb{C}^{F\times T}$, an input
mixture $Y \in \mathbb{C}^{F\times T}$, and a net's estimated
mask $\hat{M}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{F\times T}$ we compute the loss like

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{spec}} = \Big\| |S_i| - \hat{M}_i \odot |Y| \Big\|_p,
$$

where$\odot$ denotes element-wise product adn $p$ is the _norm_ of
the loss value. Only two norms are widely
used in source separation, the L1 norm where $p=1$ and the L2, or
euclidean norm where $p=2$. The L2 norm is commonly referred to as
_Mean Squared Error_ or MSE.


#### Spectrogram Targets


There is some nuance in selecting how you determine the spectrogram of the isolated
source $S_i$. Just using the magnitude spectrogram as the target is called
the _Magnitude Spectrum Approximation_ or MSA {cite}`weninger2014discriminatively`.
This is just the same equation as above unmodified:

$$
\text{MSA} =  |S_i| - \hat{M}_i \odot |Y|
$$


However, as we mentioned in previous sections computing the magnitude
spectrogram neglects the phase. We can incorporate some aspect of
the phase data by including it in our target calculation like so


$$
\text{tPSA} = \hat{M}_{i} \odot |Y|  - \operatorname{T}_{0}^{|Y|}\left(|S_i| \odot \cos(\angle S_i - \angle Y)\right)
$$


where $\angle S_i$ is the true
phase of Source i, $\angle Y$ is the mixture phase, and
$\operatorname{T}_{0}^{|Y|}(x)= \min(\max(x,0),|Y|)$ is a truncation
function ensuring the target can be reached with a sigmoid activation function.
Specifically, we incorporate constructive and destructive interference 
of the source and mixture into the target with the term $\cos(\angle S_i - \angle Y)$.


```{tip}
We have found L1 loss using the tPSA target is the best option for 
loss and target. 
```

### Deep Clustering Losses

```{figure} ../../images/deep_approaches/dc_loss.png
---
alt: Diagram of the deep clustering loss.
name: dc_loss
scale: 25%
---
The deep clustering loss encourages a network to learn a high dimensional
embedding space where TF bins from the same source are close and TF bins
from different sources are far.
```

Deep Clustering {cite}`hershey2016deep,luo2017deep` losses are usually
used with spectrograms as input.
The goal is to learn a high-dimensional embedding space
where all of the TF bins dominated by the same source close together
and TF bins dominated by different sources are far apart. 

For the single-channel, ground truth binary mask $Y \in \{0.0, 1.0\}^{T \times F}$ of 
some source, we reshape it so that it has shape ${T F \times 1}$. We then
learn a $D$-dimensional embedding space called $V \in \mathbb{R}^{TF \times D}$.
We define a ground truth binary affinity matrix $A = YY^T$, and an
estimated affinity matrix from the network $\hat{A} = VV^T$. The deep
clustering loss is thus given by,

$$
\mathcal{L}_{DC} = || \hat{A} - A ||^2_F = || VV^T - YY^T ||^2_F
$$

where $F$ is the Frobenius norm. Other types of deep clustering
losses have been proposed, {cite}`wang2018alternative,chen2017deep`
but the intuition is the same: put TF bins from the same source close to one
another and far from TF bins from other sources.

Once the network is trained, a clustering algorithm such as k-means must
be used to create masks for each source if the network has no other outputs.
As we will see in the next section, deep clustering is frequently used as a
regularizer to help learn a mask directly. 

### Waveform Losses

The simple way to compute loss in the waveform domain is to take an L1 or MSE
loss between the real and estimated waveform, similar to how we did for
spectrograms:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{wvfm}} = \Big\| \hat{x}_i - x_i \Big\|_p = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \Big\| \hat{x}_{i,t} - x_{i,t} \Big\|_p
$$

where $\hat{x}_i$ is the estimated waveform for source $i$ and $x_i$
is the ground truth waveform for source $i$, $T$ is the total number of 
samples in the source, and $p$ is the norm (1 for L1, 2 for MSE).
{cite}`defossez2019music`


Alternatively, we can emulate the evaluation metrics (SDR & Friends) by using
that as a loss function. {cite}`luo2018tasnet` For

$$
x_{\text{target}} = \frac{\langle \hat{x}, x \rangle x}{\|x\|^2 }
$$

and

$$
e_{\text{noise}} = \hat{x} - x_{\text{target}},
$$

the SI-SNR loss is

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SI-SNR}} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{\| x_{\text{target}} \|^2}{\| e_{\text{noise}} \|^2} \right).
$$

This is essentially optimizing the for the SDR evaluation metric. Variants
include using SI-SDR itself as a loss function; the calculations are
very similar.


## Other Important Pieces

* **Optimizers**:
    * Optimizers actually perform gradient descent to update the weights of your
      model. Most people use Adam. Important hyperparameters include the learning
      rate, and gradient clipping. We will discuss this more in detail.
* **Batch Size**:
    * Batch size is the number of training examples in your mini-batch that
      the gradients are computed on. Typically, the bigger the better; use
      the largest power of 2 that you can fit on your GPU.
* **Epochs**
    * This is the number of times you cycle through all of your data. Typically
      people train for a round number, like 100 epochs. Early stopping is
      also a good trick. Early stopping means that you stop training when
      the loss on the validation set stops decreasing (this is a sign that
      your model is overfitting to the training set). More on data considerations
      in a later section.


## Next Steps...

Now that we know what the building blocks are, we can put them together
to make whole networks. We'll see how that's done on the next page.
