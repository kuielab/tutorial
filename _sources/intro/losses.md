=================

It is challenging to measure the quality of a source separation method.
There are two main categories for measuring the quality of a source separation approach in general: objective and subjective.

Subjective evaluation
Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) [Vincent et al. 2006]
Calculate SDR within 1s windows or on the entire song.
A higher SDR indicate better performance.

SI-SDR, SAR, SIR, SNR,...
Objective evaluation
Mean Opinion Score (MOS)
Human rating: 1~5 
Higher MOS means better listener experience.
