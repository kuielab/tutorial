Hello and welcome to the website for our tutorial at [ISMIR 2020](https://ismir.github.io/ISMIR2020/)!
We're excited that you've decided to join us!

In this tutorial, we will guide you through modern, open-source tooling and datasets
for running, evaluating, researching, and deploying source separation approaches. 
We will pay special attention to musical source separation, though we will note
where certain approaches are applicable to a wider array of source types. 

#### Desired Outcomes

The goal of this tutorial is that you leave with:

1. A practical overview of source separation, including some history and current
   research trends,
2. A high-level intuition for how and why each source separation approach works,
3. The ability to make an educated decision about when and how to incorporate source
   separation into your own work,
4. A set of well-tested, open-source tools that you can use if you do choose to
   incorporate source separation into your work, or train your own models.
   
After you go through this tutorial, you should be confident about using source
separation in your work and you should know which tools to reach for. We hope
this website will serve as a reference guide or starting point for your future
endeavours with source separation technology.
